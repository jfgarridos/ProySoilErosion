## Soil Erosion: Land-Use-Land-Cover Prediction for province Imbabura-Ecuador
This study shows the steps towards constructing a machine learning pipeline for predicting the land use and land cover for the region of Imbabura of Republic of Ecuador. We use satellite images obtained by ESAâ€™s Sentinel-2 with use [SentinelHUb](https://apps.sentinel-hub.com/) to train a model and use it for prediction. We use Google Colab with a TPU hosted runtime. The research will lead you through the whole process of creating the pipeline, with details provided at each step.
